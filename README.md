Refactoring Date.java - Due Jan 26th


The Eclipse/Github communication was giving me a hard time, so I just created a new file each upload and copy/pasted my code from the same "Data.java" file in eclipse.
I think the error came from "generating a new token" every time I tried to link to the Repository. I was following a google guide for what to do when username/password didn't work,
and it seemed to have messed me up more. I am doing further testing so i dont have this issue on future projects.
